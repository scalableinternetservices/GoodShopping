### Frontend
 - [ ] Make sure `yarn` is installed on your system.
    - For example, on arch, run `sudo pacman -S yarn`
 - [ ] Run `bundle exec rake webpacker:install:react`
    - This will install react for rails
    - If this command throws a permission denied error, run ``chown -R `whoami` node_modules``

## Frontend Updates
